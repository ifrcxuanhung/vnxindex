PAPER000001	Empirical Research of Disposition Effects in Vietnam’s Stock Market	Disposition effect, extrapolation bias, prospect theory, behavioral finance.	This paper examines some cognitive biases of Vietnamese stock investors by ana- lyzing trading records for 1,201 accounts at a brokerage firm. These investors tend to make poor trading decisions by selling good stocks and buying bad stocks. They demonstrate a significant reference to holding the losing stocks and selling the win- ing stocks which is known as the disposition effect. It provokes many implications for researchers, market practitioners and policy makers.	VNJED	2012	August	14	2	 52-71	Empirical Research of Disposition Effects in Vietnam’s Stock Market.pdf
